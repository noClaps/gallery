# Aperturic Focus

A website to showcase some cool photos I've taken.

## Build instructions

1.  ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/noClaps/gallery.git
    cd gallery
    ```

2.  ```sh
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

    Then open `localhost:4321` in your browser to see the live preview of the site.

3.  ```sh

    ```
    
    This will build the site and place it in `dist/`.
